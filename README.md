## Development

Built with Vue.js and Electron, Empress Finance prioritizes security with offline capabilities and local database storage using SQLite.

### Getting Started

1. **Pre-requisites**: Ensure Node.js (v16.14.0) and npm are installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for installation. Yarn is also required and can be installed from [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

2. **Setup**:

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/empress-eco/books.git
```

Change directory

```bash
cd books
```

Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

**Run in Development Mode**:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Note: On first boot, the UI may take a moment to render due to individual file serving in development mode.

**Build for Production**:

yarn build
```
